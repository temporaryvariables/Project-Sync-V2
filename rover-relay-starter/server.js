// rover-relay-starter
// =============================================================================
// This is your STARTING POINT — a deliberately empty scaffold.
//
// Mission Control (the Deep Space Network) sends each command to this service at
// POST /replicate. Your job is to forward every command to the three ground
// stations (NASA, ESA, JAXA) so they all end up holding the same value, in the
// right order, even when deep space gets noisy (blackouts, throttling, latency,
// out-of-order delivery).
//
// Right now this scaffold does almost nothing: it accepts the request, writes a
// single example log line, and returns an empty response. It does NOT talk to
// the stations yet — that part is up to you.
//
// Your mission: implement the forwarding inside POST /replicate. Suggested order
// of difficulty as you make it resilient:
//   1. Write to all three stations (start sequential, then go parallel).
//   2. Retry with exponential backoff when a station returns HTTP 500.
//   3. Respect HTTP 429 + Retry-After when a station is throttling.
//   4. Keep sequence numbers monotonic so stale writes (HTTP 409) don't win.
//   5. Add a queue / persistence so nothing is lost mid-flight.
// =============================================================================

// `express` is the HTTP framework that turns this file into a web server.
import express from "express";
// `cors` lets browsers and other origins call this service without being blocked
// by the browser's same-origin policy. Mission Control runs on a different host,
// so we enable it.
import cors from "cors";

// The TCP port this server listens on. Read it from the environment if present
// (your hosting platform sets PORT), otherwise default to 4000 for local dev.
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

// Where the three ground stations live. You will send your PUT writes to URLs
// built from this base, e.g. `${GROUND_STATION_URL}/groundstation/nasa/<selector>`.
// `normalizeUrl` (defined below) tolerates a bare host or a full http(s) URL.
const GROUND_STATION_URL = normalizeUrl(process.env.GROUND_STATION_URL, "http://localhost:3001");

// Where to send your own log lines so they appear in Mission Control's trace,
// interleaved with the platform's logs for the same command. Point this at the
// same Flight Director URL Mission Control uses. Set RELAY_LOGGING=false to mute.
const FLIGHT_DIRECTOR_URL = normalizeUrl(process.env.FLIGHT_DIRECTOR_URL, "http://localhost:3002");

// A simple on/off switch for your logging. Logging is on unless you explicitly
// set RELAY_LOGGING=false. (`!== "false"` means "anything other than the string
// 'false' counts as enabled".)
const RELAY_LOGGING = process.env.RELAY_LOGGING !== "false";

// The three stations you must keep in sync. You'll loop over these when you
// implement forwarding. Left here as a hint — nothing reads it yet.
const STATIONS = ["nasa", "esa", "jaxa"];

// Accept a service URL with or without a scheme. A bare host like
// "stations.example.com" becomes "https://stations.example.com", while an
// explicit "http://ground-station-api:3001" is left untouched. This keeps the
// env vars forgiving whether you paste a domain or a full URL.
function normalizeUrl(value, fallback) {
  // Use the provided value, fall back to the default, and trim stray whitespace.
  const v = (value || fallback || "").trim();
  // If it's empty, return it as-is (nothing to normalize).
  if (!v) return v;
  // If it already starts with http:// or https://, keep it; otherwise assume https.
  return /^https?:\/\//i.test(v) ? v : `https://${v}`;
}

// Create the Express application instance.
const app = express();
// Enable CORS for every route so cross-origin callers (Mission Control) are allowed.

// missionLog(): send ONE line of your own story to Mission Control.
//
// What it does: makes a fire-and-forget POST to the Flight Director's /logs
// endpoint. "Fire and forget" means we never `await` it and we swallow any
// error (`.catch(() => {})`), so logging can never slow down or break a
// replication. If logging is disabled, or we're missing the auth token /
// correlation id / Flight Director URL, it simply does nothing.
//
// Why a correlation id: every command carries an X-Correlation-Id. Sending it
// with your log lets Mission Control stitch your message into the same end-to-end
// trace as the platform's own log lines for that command.
//
// Fields you can pass:
//   level      "info" | "success" | "warn" | "error"  (controls the color/badge)
//   step       a short machine name for this moment, e.g. "relay.received"
//   selector   which command this is about
//   station    optional station name if the line is about one station
//   message    the human-readable sentence shown in the dashboard
//   properties any extra key/values to attach (shown as chips in the trace)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
